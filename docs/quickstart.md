# Quick Start
This guide provides a quick introduction to using Apollos AI. We'll cover the essential installation steps and running your first Skill.

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Install Docker Desktop

Download and install Docker Desktop for your operating system:

- **Windows:** Download from [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and run the installer with default settings
- **macOS:** Download for Apple Silicon or Intel, drag to Applications, and enable the Docker socket in Settings > Advanced
- **Linux:** Install Docker Desktop or docker-ce following the [official instructions](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)

> [!TIP]
> For complete OS-specific installation instructions, see the [full Installation Guide](setup/installation.md#step-1-install-docker-desktop).

### Step 2: Pull the Apollos AI Image

Using Docker Desktop GUI, search for `ghcr.io/jrmatherly/apollos-ai` and click Pull, or use the terminal:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/jrmatherly/apollos-ai
```

### Step 3: Run the Container

**Using Docker Desktop:** Go to Images tab, click Run next to `ghcr.io/jrmatherly/apollos-ai`, open Optional settings, map a host port to container port `80` (use `0` for automatic assignment), then click Run.

**Using Terminal:**

```bash
docker run -p 0:80 ghcr.io/jrmatherly/apollos-ai
```

The container will start in a few seconds. Find the mapped port in Docker Desktop (shown as `<PORT>:80`).

### Step 4: Open the Web UI and Configure API Key

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:<PORT>`. The Web UI will show a warning banner about missing API key.

Click **Add your API key** to open Settings and configure:

- **Providers:** Apollos AI supports many LLM providers including Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Groq, Azure OpenAI, Ollama (local models), LM Studio, and others
- **Model Selection:** Choose your chat model in Settings. The default configuration uses Google Gemini, but you can switch to any supported provider
- **API Key:** Enter the API key for your chosen provider

> [!NOTE]
> Apollos AI supports any LLM provider compatible with LiteLLM, including local models via Ollama. For detailed provider configuration and local model setup, see the [Installation Guide](setup/installation.md#choosing-your-llms).

Chats are saved in JSON format in the `usr/chats` directory (or under tenant-scoped paths in multi-user deployments).
